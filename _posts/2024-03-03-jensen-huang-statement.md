# About Mr. Jensen Huang statement

Jensen Huang's recent comments about AI rendering coding obsolete might be more about generating clout than reflecting a distinctive understanding of the future of technology.

The debate over the future of coding has recently reignited. While some, like Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, believe AI will make coding obsolete, others hold a different perspective. This article is an opposing viewpoint, exploring why coding might remain relevant despite the rise of artificial intelligence.

While advancements in AI are undeniable, suggesting it will completely replace the need for coding is an overly simplistic and potentially misleading view.
**AI is not a silver bullet**. While AI tools can automate repetitive tasks and generate code, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution.

Complex projects still require human expertise in areas like:
1. **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**: Identifying the problem, defining its scope, and crafting the right solution are crucial steps that AI cannot fully replace. 
2. **Domain Expertise**: Understanding the specific industry or application is essential for creating effective and efficient code. AI, while powerful, cannot replicate the human capacity for experience and specialized knowledge.
3. **Creativity and innovation**: Pushing boundaries and developing new technologies often requires human ingenuity and the ability to think outside the box.


The future of work may involve collaboration: Instead of AI replacing coding entirely, it's more likely we'll see a shift towards humans and AI working together. Developers may utilize AI tools to streamline tasks, **allowing them to focus on higher-level aspects like design, architecture, and problem-solving**.

Learning to code can still be valuable, even if the specific coding languages change or become more user-friendly, the underlying logic and problem-solving skills gained through coding remain valuable. These skills can be applied in various fields, not just programming, and foster critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and computational thinking.

Therefore, while AI brings exciting advancements, it's crucial to maintain a nuanced understanding of its capabilities and limitations.

In conclusion, while **AI undoubtedly presents exciting advancements**, it is crucial to maintain a balanced perspective on its capabilities and limitations. Coding, along with its core principles, will likely continue to play a significant role in the future, even if its form and application evolve alongside AI.
