Since 2021, I've been working as a Software Engineer Student at Universide do Minho. 

I enjoy working on opensource for fun.
Recently I've been busy learning Elixir by contributing to multiple repositories at [CeSIUM](https://github.com/cesium/).

I'm still learning and exploring various areas of computer science and software engineering though, and I'll try to share what I've learned in this blog. 

I live in Braga, Portugal.
