        <p>Jensen Huang’s recent comments about AI rendering coding obsolete might be more about generating clout than reflecting a distinctive understanding of the future of technology.</p>

<p>The debate over the future of coding has recently reignited. While some, like Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, believe AI will make coding obsolete, others hold a different perspective. This article is an opposing viewpoint, exploring why coding might remain relevant despite the rise of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>While advancements in AI are undeniable, suggesting it will completely replace the need for coding is an overly simplistic and potentially misleading view.
<strong>AI is not a silver bullet</strong>. While AI tools can automate repetitive tasks and generate code, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>

<p>Complex projects still require human expertise in areas like:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</strong>: Identifying the problem, defining its scope, and crafting the right solution are crucial steps that AI cannot fully replace.</li>
  <li><strong>Domain Expertise</strong>: Understanding the specific industry or application is essential for creating effective and efficient code. AI, while powerful, cannot replicate the human capacity for experience and specialized knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity and innovation</strong>: Pushing boundaries and developing new technologies often requires human ingenuity and the ability to think outside the box.</li>
</ol>

<p>The future of work may involve collaboration: Instead of AI replacing coding entirely, it’s more likely we’ll see a shift towards humans and AI working together. Developers may utilize AI tools to streamline tasks, <strong>allowing them to focus on higher-level aspects like design, architecture, and problem-solving</strong>.</p>

<p>Learning to code can still be valuable, even if the specific coding languages change or become more user-friendly, the underlying logic and problem-solving skills gained through coding remain valuable. These skills can be applied in various fields, not just programming, and foster critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and computational thinking.</p>

<p>Therefore, while AI brings exciting advancements, it’s crucial to maintain a nuanced understanding of its capabilities and limitations.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while <strong>AI undoubtedly presents exciting advancements</strong>, it is crucial to maintain a balanced perspective on its capabilities and limitations. Coding, along with its core principles, will likely continue to play a significant role in the future, even if its form and application evolve alongside AI.</p>
